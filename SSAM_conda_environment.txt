# When using R with conda, some people recommend to install all R packages via conda and not let R install packages. This is because R looks for header files (i.e. dev libraries) in canonical locations where these files are typically located when installed by the OS package manager. For more on R with conda, see this answer on the RStudio forum.

conda install -c conda-forge r-sctransform 
conda install -c conda-forge r-feather


# Install SSAM via pip:
pip install ssam
